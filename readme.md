AutoprintJAMB is an automation tool built in python using Selenium, that is aimed at helping the Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board(JAMB) examination enrollers
efficiently and effortlessly print and save examination slips of their numerous candidates for later printing.

HOW TO USE (Below steps assume you already have python 3.x installed):
- clone the repo 
- Install all dependencies in 'requirements.txt' by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" or 
install manually globally.
- Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), which needs to be installed before any browser interaction. Make sure it’s in your PATH, i.e, place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
- open app.py and append all your reg numbers to the 'regNumbers' list and save
- run app.py

More features rolling in, in the near future.
Cheers!
